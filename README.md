# Tech Journal

My personal, lifetime knowledge base for tech learnings.

**What it is**  
A simple web app to add, search, edit & delete notes/entries. Built as a learning project during my Code Institute full-stack bootcamp (finishing ~Feb 2026). Started with vanilla JavaScript + localStorage – plans to add Django backend, user auth, cloud hosting, and more over time.

**Why this repo?**  
- Reinforce what I learn by writing it down  
- Track progress from beginner → job-ready dev  
- Interests: cloud computing, cyber security, full-stack dev  
- Daily/weekly commits to keep skills sharp

**Current features**  
- Add notes with title, content & tags  
- Real-time search  
- Delete entries  
- Data persists in browser (localStorage)

**Tech stack so far**  
- HTML5 / CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- LocalStorage for persistence

**Future ideas**  
- Edit notes  
- Categories/folders  
- Markdown support & code highlighting  
- Export to PDF/Markdown  
- Python
- Django + PostgreSQL backend  
- AWS/GCP deployment  
- Basic auth & encryption (cyber practice)
